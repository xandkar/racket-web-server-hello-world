Racket Web Server hello-world app
=================================

I wanted to run a simple instance of the Racket Web Server,
dove into the docs,
resurfaced with the code captured in this repo.

Each required module is prefixed so it is clear what is coming from where!

Example usage
-------------

From terminal A:

    $ ./server --help
    usage: ./server [ <option> ... ] [<directories-to-serve-static-files-from>] ...

    <option> is one of

      -d, --dev
	 Development mode: open browser, show stack traces, etc.
      -a <ip-addr>, --addr <ip-addr>
	 Listen address.
      -p <port-number>, --port <port-number>
	 Listen port.
      -l <file>, --log <file>
	 Log file.
      --help, -h
	 Show this help
      --
	 Do not treat any remaining argument as a switch (at this level)

     Multiple single-letter switches can be combined after
     one `-`. For example, `-h-` is the same as `-h --`.

    $ ./server
    Your Web application is running at http://localhost:8000.
    Stop this program at any time to terminate the Web Server.

From terminal B:

    $ curl -i localhost:8000/hello
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Server: Racket
